A URI-like format for serializing cryptographic objects including keys,
signatures, and digests using URI generic syntax:

```
crypto:public:key:ed25519:6adfsqvzky9t042tlmfujeq88g8wzuhnm2nzxfd0qgdx3ac82ydq3pkr2c
```

A URI-safe "dasherized" form is also supported:

```
crypto-public-key-ed25519-6adfsqvzky9t042tlmfujeq88g8wzuhnm2nzxfd0qgdx3ac82ydqc3p98e
```

## About CryptoURI

The CryptoURI format leverages the URI generic syntax defined in [RFC 3986] to
provide simple and succinct encodings of cryptographic keys, including public
keys, private/secret keys, encrypted secret keys with password-based key
derivation, digital signatures, key fingerprints, and other digests.

Binary data is serialized using the [Bech32] encoding format which is designed
to prevent human transcription errors by using an alphabet that eliminates
similar-looking characters to avoid transcription errors and adds a checksum
across the whole URI to detect these errors when they do happen.
CryptoURIs which have been mis-transcribed will fail to decode.
